A very simple, light-weight execution context (eg. browser window) which wraps around [can-simple-dom](https://github.com/canjs/can-simple-dom). This module allows for both jQuery, CanJS, ReactJS, and other scripts to be loaded in a NodeJS environment by creating a faux browser window in which the scripts are executed. A very basic implementation of the DOM API is provided by can-simple-dom.
